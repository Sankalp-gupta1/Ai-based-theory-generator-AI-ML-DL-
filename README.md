# 📚 AI-Based PDF Theory Generator using Transformers

An intelligent academic tool that extracts textual content from PDF documents and generates structured theory using NLP and transformer-based models. Designed to assist students and educators by converting raw academic material into human-readable, meaningful content automatically.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📄 Upload academic PDFs and extract clean text
- 🧠 Generate topic-wise theory using transformer-based language models (e.g., GPT/BERT)
- 🔍 Semantic understanding and summarization using sentence embeddings
- 📌 Key concepts detection, topic extraction, and auto-structuring
- 🌐 Flask-based web interface for seamless interaction

## 🧠 Core Concepts Implemented

- **Text Extraction** using `PyMuPDF` to read and clean raw PDF data  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for topic understanding and chunking  
- **Sentence Embeddings** using `SentenceTransformers` for semantic similarity  
- **Transformer Models** (BERT/GPT) via `Hugging Face Transformers` for generation  
- **Flask Framework** to build an interactive local web application
